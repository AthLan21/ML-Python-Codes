2 - High

3 - Very high

2)      Split the data into training and testing parts : 80% for training and 20% for testing.

3)      Note down the output of your program for the following :

i)                    Accuracy

ii)                  confusion matrix

iii)                Prediction for feature matrix :

[842,0,2.2,0,1,0,7,0.6,188,2,2,20,756,2549,9,7,19,0,0,1 ]

 

4) Write these values within comments at the end of your source code.
